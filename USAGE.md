# Makara Usage

Makara is designed to be configured solely via your `database.yml`. This means there are no initializers, there are no race conditions, and deployments are not impacted by using Makara.

## Configuring your database.yml

The minimal `database.yml` you'll need to get things running looks like (optional defaults exposed):

    production:
      adapter: makara_mysql2
      sticky_master: true         // optional
      sticky_slaves: true         // optional
      blacklist_duration: 60      // optional
      verbose: false              // optional

      database: my_project_db
      username: root
      password: 

      databases:
        - name: master
          role: master

To define a slave database, provide another database with either the role removed or as `slave`.

    production:
      ...
      databases:
        - name: master
          role: master
        - name: slave 1

By default the databases will inherit the top-level db configuration. The best practice is to put the shared options in the top-level and define all the differences in each sub-config. In the example below, the `username` and `password` options will be shared among all the sub-configs.

    production:
      adapter: makara_mysql2
      username: the-user
      password: the-password

      databases:
        - name: master
          role: master
          database: prod-db-master
        - name: slave 1
          database: prod-db-slave-1
        - name: slave 2
          database: prod-db-slave-2

## Configuration options

The following are definitions of the options available to the makara adapter:

* ansi_colors:
  - [boolean]
  - if makara should decorate it's output with insanely pretty colors

* blacklist_duration:
  - [integer]
  - the number of seconds a node is blacklisted before attempting a reconnect
  - can be configured globally or on a per-db basis

* sticky_master:
  - [boolean]
  - once a master connection is used, it will continue using that connection until the adapter is told to `unstick!`
  - takes priority over sticky_slave

* sticky_slave:
  - [boolean]
  - once a slave connection is read from, it will continue using that connection until the adapter is told to `unstick!`

* verbose
  - [boolean]
  - whether the makara adapter should log information about it's decisions

* name
  - [per-db]
  - [string]
  - the name used to identify this connection. 
  - should be unique

* role
  - [string]
  - per-db, optional for slaves
  - the role this connection should take on (master or slave)
  - if ommitted, assumed to be slave
